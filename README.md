# Fulhaus_project

### Overview

For this project, I have taken the given datasets containing images of beds, chairs, and sofas.

To begin, I chose a convolutional neural network to evaluate the given training images and classify them as one of three classes.

Next, I chose to use flask to create an api, allowing users to input an image and to receive a classification result based on the given model.

To deliver the flask api app, I used docker to package it according to pip freeze to accurately capture the current requirements.

Finally, I used github action actions to create a repository for hosting the page.
